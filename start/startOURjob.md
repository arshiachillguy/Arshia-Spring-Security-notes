# What is Spring Security؟ What's the use؟ And why do we need to learn it؟ 

Actually, these questions did not occur to me at all, in the first stage, immediately after Spring Boot, after hearing the name Spring Security, it occurred to me to come and learn it, but now those questions came to me, so I went to ask from different places to get the answers to these questions.

<u> Spring Security is a framework for the security of Java applications, not any application. 
When engineers realized that they had to protect their resources, what are these resources?
Users' passwords, usernames, users' information, are generally among the other sources of accounting, or for example, blocking users' access (unauthorized access), providing security against common attacks, supporting authentication methods, etc. </u>
With these explanations, it is clear why we should learn it. 
The combination of spring boots, spring security and other important things that I want to learn in the future can help me make interesting things for you.
